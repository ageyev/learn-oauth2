# Learn OAuth 2

As defined in ["The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework" (RFC 6749)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749), the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party  application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
